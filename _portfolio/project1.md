### Problem Statement 
Atliq Hardware is a company which manufactures computer hardware and peripherals. They supply these products to many stores across India. Sales director of this company is facing many challenges. The market is growing dynamically and sales director is having issues tracking the sales from different regions. He wants to track the trends in different markets in order to improve the operations of the business but in the current situation this tracking is flawed. This is crucial because, he needs to point out the issues where the sales are declining and also focus on the regions where the business is going good. Usually, sales director calls the regional managers on phone in order to gain insights on regional sales. This method can be misleading in terms of sales insights since there is a lot of room for human bias. Furthermore, when the sales volume is very diverse and large, the verbal communication over the phone is going to be inferior to visual representations when it comes to recognizing trends and patterns in the data. The regional managers, apart from the verbal communication, also deliver many excel files with huge number of rows. However, it is very time consuming to find the necessary insight on how the sales are going from these excel files.
<br>Therefore, the aim of this project is to create a dynamic Power BI dashboard where the user can easily access valuable graphs and charts. The raw data from the excel files must be organized and their relations must be set in order to create this dashboard. The related performance measures must be calculated, and their behavior over the time should be available as well. This dashboard must present the necessary truthful insights and knowledge to the manager, so that he can use this to support his decisions confidently, resulting in a more successful business.
### Project Planning and Data Discovery
In the aimâ€™s grid below you can see four components of the project which are: purpose, stakeholders, end result and success criteria. The aim of this project is presented clearly by this figure. IT team of Atliq hardware uses a MySQL database connected to their sales management system. This database will be the source of our Power BI dashboard.
