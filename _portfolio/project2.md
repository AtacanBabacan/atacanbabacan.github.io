With a team of 5, we have investigated the problem situation in this big bolt and nut warehouse. We have found out that the exit area was the bottleneck of the warehouse and improvements on this area would increase the output of the warehouse. Automated strech wrapping machines alongside with conveyor system was considered as an alternative to the existing manual work in the exit area. The calculation of the benefits of this system is not straightforward because most of the parameters in the system are stochastic. We have developped a simulation model for testing out the performance and reliability of this solution. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to decide between two alternative conveyor systems. A detailed project report is available on request.
